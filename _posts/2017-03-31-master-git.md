Using Git can be the easiest yet most frustrating part of becoming a developer. It's as simple as a quick tutorial to get into, yet I promise it will take a long time to perfect. But Git is a _need to know_ for every coder. Check out this great tutorial that breaks down mastering the art of Git.

### Make it a habit!

Adnan offers some simple TLDR; steps for learning Git through habit:

* `git status` all the time!

* Try only to change files you really want to change.

* `git add -A` is your friend.

<div class="note_box"><strong>Note from me:</strong> Seriously it is! I've gotten in a nasty habit of just doing `git add .`, adding all of my files to a commit everytime instead of just the specific one I'm changing. This can create waves of issues if you are editing multiple files at the same time!</div>

* Feel free to `git commit -m "meaningful messages"`.

<div class="note_box"><strong>Another note from me:</strong> Again, seriously, meaningful messages! It's easy to just write whatever (literally, I find myself writing `whatever` a lot) to get the commit saved. But that won't help down the line when you need to remember what you've just screwed up ;)</div>

* Always `git pull` *before* doing any pushing, but *after* you have committed any changes.

* Finally, `git push` the committed changes.
