I found this easy tutorial that brings together a few different technologies to create a quick SEO-friendly, CMS-powered blog. Take a look at what's involved and read the tutorial!

<a href="https://dev.to/rogerjin12/how-to-build-a-seo-friendly-react-blog-with-an-api-based-cms" target="_blank">Roger Jin's tutorial "How to build a SEO-friendly React blog with an API-based CMS" on dev.to</a>

### Tech involved

* React - Declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building impactful user interfaces
* Next.js - Minimalistic framework for server-rendered React apps
* ButterCMS - A hosted API similiar to WordPress with different language support

### What it does

Build a blog interface with React and use Roger's tutorial to quickly wrap a  framework around it! Roger's tutorial pointed me in the direction of Next.js, an easy way to serve your React apps (removing the steps of grabbing and setting up a webpack server on your own, which Next.js uses and does for you). Next.js also includes everything you need to use Babel (important in React to translate your JSX to plain JS). Lastly his tutorial introduced me to ButterCMS, which can initally be used for free. You can manage your blog content through a nice WordPress-style web API, and serve it to your website through the language of your choice!
