    <h3 class="column-head">Let's talk about me</h3>
    <h4 class="p-header">I am a web designer.</h4>
    <p>I am a web designer who loves the internet, marvelous looking gadgets, and generally all things tech. Solving a programming problem or finishing getting that little bit of brilliant css excites me. A well designed website and highly functional program can be a piece of art.</p>
    <h4 class="p-header">What that means I do.</h4>
    <p>I find myself entranced by almost anything. I have been told my interests can be all over the place. The world is full of so much to learn and see. I love spending the majority of my <i>actual</i> free time outside, exploring. Whether that means walking around the block, climbing a mountain, or traveling across the world, I simply enjoy the sensation of experiencing something new. I’m also into computers, addicting video games, hockey (let’s see if the Penguins can win the Stanley Cup again!), a bit of photography, and keeping my cat company. Over the years I’ve dabbled in a little bit of everything.</p>
    <h4 class="p-header">Why I love the things I do.</h4>
    <p>One of my earliest memories is sitting in front of a Commodore 64, aimlessly pressing the keyboard and watching magic appear on the bright screen in front of me. I have always had a deep fascination with technology, and have always wanted to be a part of the wizardry behind it. I get a warm feeling from finishing projects and helping people. I spent 12 years an retail customer service, 7 of those years in senior management. I can manage projects, people, and most importantly myself. I have an impulse to always be better at what I do. No challenge is ever too much, and never being challenged is ultimately boring.</p>

    <h3 class="column-head">Let's talk about you</h3>
    <h4 class="p-header">You are totally awesome.</h4>
    <p>You are Imagemakers. You build magnificent customized web marketing solutions. You have great people, cool benefits, and a passion to be the best.</p>
    <h4 class="p-header">You need the best to stay awesome.</h4>
    <p>You need people who will meet your high standards and strive to set the bar higher. You need a team player who will help see projects to completion, but also an individual who isn’t afraid to bring new ideas to the table.</p>
    <h4 class="p-header">I'm awesome.</h4>
    <p>I didn’t make this page lightly, and have spent some time considering if I should really pursue this job. I’m yearning for a new challenge, and Imagemakers needs good front end developers. You need real problem solvers for your customers, and I happen to be a problem solver.</p>
