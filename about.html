	<hr>
	
	<p>My name is Jamie Locatis. After spending twelve years in retail management, I decided it was time for a change. Back to the roots of something I always enjoyed.</p>

	<p>I designed my first website in 1999, when I was just 12 years old. I spent years prowling the internet building and running various fansites. Early in college I was offered a fast tracked management career with a retail company I started at in high school. It was a no-brainer. I gained invaluable business skills and leadership experience.</p>

	<p>But the time came to move on. I attended <a href="http://www.omahacodeschool.com/" target="_blank">Omaha Code School</a> in the Spring of 2017 to get a jumpstart on modern web development practices.</p>

	<p>This blog is a place where I can explore and share some of the challenges I have encountered through my development journey.</p>
