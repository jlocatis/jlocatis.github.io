	<p>My name is Jamie Locatis. Welcome to my adventure, the journey from retail management to software development. After spending twelve years with the same retail company, seven of those years in senior store management, I decided it was time for a change. Back to the roots of something I have always enjoyed.</p>

	<p>One of my very first memories as a child is being introduced to computers on my grandfather's Commodore 64. I designed my first website in 1999, when I was just 12 years old. I spent years prowling the internet building and running various fansites. I helped to design and edit one of the earliest and largest <em>Warcraft</em> fansites at a time before <em>World of Warcraft</em> existed. Computers and technology have always been this special, magical thing for me. One of my biggest regrets in life was never making this professional journey sooner.</p>

	<p>Early in college I was offered a fast tracked management career with a retail company I started at in high school. To a freshman in college who was already racking up debt, it was an easy no-brainer. This side tracked my original plans but I'm fortunate I took the opportunity. I acquired crucial business skills and leadership experience, the opportunity to explore a new part of the country, and so much more.</p>

	<p>But the time came to move on. To reinvent myself. And I couldn't stop thinking about my dream of always working with computers. So I took the plunge and attended <a href="http://www.omahacodeschool.com/" target="_blank">Omaha Code School</a>, graduating in the Spring of 2017. Their intensive 16 week development bootcamp provided me a jumpstart on modern web development practices.</p>

	<p>As I take the next step of finding my place in this whole new world, I  look forward to continuous learning and helping those looking to do the same. This blog is a place where I can explore and share some of the challenges and triumphs I have encountered through my development journey. Give me a shout if you have any comments or questions.</p>
