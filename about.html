	<p>My name is Jamie Locatis. Welcome to my adventure, the journey from retail management to software development. After spending twelve years with the same retail company, seven of those years in senior store management, I decided it was time for a change. Back to the roots of something I have always enjoyed.</p>

	<p>One of my very first memories as a child is being introduced to computers on my grandfather's Commodore 64. I designed my first website in 1999, when I was just 12 years old. I spent years prowling the internet building and running various fansites. I can proudly say I helped to design and edit one of the earliest and largest <em>Warcraft</em> fansites at a time before <em>World of Warcraft</em> existed. Computers and technology have always held a special, magical place in my heart. One of my biggest regrets in life was never making this professional journey sooner.</p>

	<p>Early in my irrational, young adult college days I was offered a fast tracked management career with a retail company I started at in high school. To a freshman in college who was already racking up debt, it was an easy no-brainer. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad I took the opportunity. I gained invaluable business skills and leadership experience, the opportunity to explore a new part of the country, and so much more.</p>

	<p>But the time came to move on. To reinvent myself. And I couldn't stop thinking about my dream of always working with computers. So I took the plunge and attended <a href="http://www.omahacodeschool.com/" target="_blank">Omaha Code School</a>, graduating in the Spring of 2017. Their 16 week intensive development bootcamp provided me jumpstart on modern web development practices.</p>

	<p>As I begin the next step of finding my place in this whole new career, I can only look forward to continued learning and helping those looking to do the same. This blog is a place where I can explore and share some of the challenges I have encountered through my development journey. Give me a shout if you have any comments or questions.</p>
